This repository is the backend of a project that I did with my partners. This project is a website where we sell artwork. On this site, the client can find artwork and buy it and other functions like registering, logging and filtering the work of art.
Im decided to separate the repositorie of the project in the folder of backend and the frontend because its easier for the deveployment.
For the deployment of the backend, I used a site called Heroku.
You can visit the repository of the frontend in my profile if you wish.
