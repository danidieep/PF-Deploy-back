## Introduction

This repository is the frontend of a project that I did with my partners. This project is a website where we sell artwork.
Im decided to separate the repositorie of the project in the folder of backend and the frontend because its easier for the deveployment.
For the deployment of this folder, I used a site called Vercel.
You can visit the repository of the backend in my profile if you wish.

## BoilerPlate

The boilerplate has two folders: "PF-Deploy-front" and "PF-Deploy-back".

In the folder "PF-Deploy-back" you must create an .env archive with the next strucuture.

```
DB_USER=userpostgres
DB_PASSWORD=passwordpostgres
DB_HOST=localhost
```

Replace the variables DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD with your own credentials.
